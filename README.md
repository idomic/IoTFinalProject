## IoT Final Project Spring 2018

Project by:
1. Yuval Schaal (ys3055)
2. Siao-Ting Wang (sw3092)
3. Ido Michael (im2482)

This codebase is used on the hardware parts of our system to run servers, gather data from sensors, and send information to a cloud database.

## Components
1. IOT senors API connecting to a backend server.
2. NodeJS server that runs on a Rasp PI/Arduino system.
3. Connection to AWS different services including Notifications and DB.
4. Frontend application to see live feed from the camera and control the sensors in real time.
